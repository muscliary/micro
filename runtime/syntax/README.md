# Syntax Files

Here are highlight's syntax files. If you would like to make a new syntax file, you should first check it
with the `syntax_checker.go` program. Just place it in this directory and run the program (`go run syntax_checker.go`)
and it will let you know if there are issues with any of the files in the directory.
